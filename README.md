# OPALLLMAssistantAdventure
This project aims to create a function-calling LLM as an intermediator between users and the static analysis framework OPAL.

# Installation

# Setting up a Python Environment for `functionCallingCode.py`

This guide explains how to set up a Python virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and configure the script `functionCallingCode.py`.

## 1. Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment allows you to manage project-specific dependencies independently of your system-wide Python packages.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, your terminal prompt should display the name of the virtual environment, e.g., (venv).

## 2. Install Required Python Packages

With the virtual environment activated, install the groq package:

```bash
pip install groq
```

Note: If pip is not up to date, you can update it by running:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## 3. Configure functionCallingCode.py and secret_keys.py

### secret_keys.py
The repository contains a file `secret_keys_template.py`. You have to copy this file and rename it to `secret_keys.py`, then insert your own secret keys:

```python
CROQ_SECRET_API_KEY = "Insert your secret croq key"
PATH_OPAL = "Insert your path to Opal here"
PATH_DECOMPILER = "Insert your path to the cfr.jar here"
STD_LOG_PATH = "log.txt"
```

The `PATH_DECOMPILER` variable specifies the path to the decompiler required in step 2, and `STD_LOG_PATH` defines the standard file name for logging.

## 4. Install and Configure the Decompiler

We have installed a decompiler from [this link](https://www.benf.org/other/cfr/). It is called CFR and allows our LLM to disassemble Java bytecode. Users must download the decompiler JAR file and set the `PATH_DECOMPILER` variable in the configuration file accordingly.

## 5. Running the Program

Once everything is set up, you can start the program by running:

```bash
python functionCallingCode.py
```

This will launch the LLM-based interface, allowing you to interact with OPAL through function calls.

## 6. Memory System

Since the Groq API does not provide memory for LLMs, we have implemented a memory mechanism that retains conversation history. This is managed using the following class:

```python
import datetime
import json

class Memory:
    def __init__(self, max_size=30):
        self.memory = []
        self.max_size = max_size

    def get(self, newest_count=-1):
        if newest_count > len(self.memory) or newest_count < 0:
            newest_count = len(self.memory)
        return self.memory[:newest_count]
    
    def get_json_textual(self, newest_count=-1):
        content = ""
        if newest_count > len(self.memory) or newest_count < 0:
            newest_count = len(self.memory)
        for i in reversed(range(newest_count)):
            content += self.memory[i]["type"] + ": " + self.memory[i]["content"] + "\n"
        return content

    def insert(self, arg_type, content):
        self.memory.insert(0, {"type": arg_type, "content": content})
        if len(self.memory) > self.max_size:
            self.memory.pop()
```

## 7. Logging System

A logging mechanism has been added in `logger.py`, which records both user conversations and the functions executed by the LLM, including the parameters used. The log file is defined in the configuration file (`STD_LOG_PATH`) and defaults to `log.txt`. The log file resets upon restarting the program.

# Overview of Available Functions

The LLM can call the following functions:

- `get_response`: Responds to casual chat messages.
- `list_functions`: Returns a JSON listing all callable functions and their parameters.
- `string_constants_analysis`: Analyzes Java bytecode for hardcoded string values.
- `field_assignability_analysis`: Determines whether fields can be modified after initialization.
- `field_immutability_analysis`: Checks if fields remain unchanged after initialization.
- `bytecode_disassembler`: Disassembles Java bytecode and optionally saves the output.
- `hierarchy_visualisation`: Generates a `.gv` visualization file of a JARâ€™s hierarchy.
- `field_array_usage_analysis`: Analyzes how arrays stored as fields are accessed and modified.
- `local_points_to`: Tracks memory references of local variables in a program.
- `print_tac`: Prints the three-address code representation of a Java method.
- `parameter_usage_analysis`: Examines how method parameters are used or modified.
- `suggest_analysis`: Suggests relevant OPAL analysis techniques for a given `.class` file.
- `taint_analysis`: Tracks untrusted data flow from sources to sinks to detect vulnerabilities.
- `decompile_and_analyze_or_print`: Decompiles Java bytecode and prints or analyzes it based on the user's request.

This set of functions enables comprehensive analysis and manipulation of Java bytecode with OPAL and the LLM acting as an intermediary.
